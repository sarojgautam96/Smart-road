# Smart Road

Smart Road is an advanced civil engineering software tailored for designing rural roads, district roads, and highways. It addresses the unique challenges of mountainous and hilly terrains, providing tools for efficient and accurate road design.

## 🚀 Features

- **Hairpin Bend Design**: Smooth alignment with super elevation and extra widening using three curve radii inputs.
- **Customizable Structures**: Create and reuse libraries for retaining walls, breast walls, drains, and culverts.
- **Mass Haul Diagram**: Optimize earthwork volume calculations.
- **BOQ Comparison**: Analyze construction quantities and rate differences.
- **3D Terrain Modeling**: Visualize and design on 3D terrain surfaces.
- **Google Earth Compatibility**: Integrate designs with satellite imagery.
- **Comprehensive Design Tools**: Plan, profile, and cross-section designs in a single interface.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: .NET Framework, OpenGL
- **Backend**: C#
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Platform**: Windows
